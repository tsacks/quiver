# Quiver
A ready-to-use combat system for world-builders using VRChat Udon

__*This project is a work in progress, and this documentation should be expected to update frequently*__

## How it works
Quiver is a simple and extendable combat system that lets you build multiple types of melee, ranged, and thrown weapons that can interact with players and NPCs. You can customize how these weapons interact with players, and how players operate on a fundamental level.

Put pickups and health stations throughout your world, to let players heal, recharge, and reload.

Upload the demo world in order to get a working game quickly, and customize from there.
